          <h2>About Cameron Elliott</h2>
          <p>"My well-rounded experience, knowledge, and talent can greatly complement the mission that your company is trying to accomplish!
            For example, while working for myself, I built two 5-Star companies from the ground up by using communication, business, and technical skills to build my own brand, website, and scheduling software.
            I’ve developed my own mobile game that is currently on the Google Play Store.
            I’ve designed and built several of my own websites for business/portfolios etc.
            I’ve always been happiest when helping people feel better. I’ve learned to listen well and focus on programming for long periods at a time.
            I am confident that these skills will grant me the ability to perform well in any position. I learn quickly, and I’m passionate about people and technology.
            I’m excited to learn new things and grow professionally."</p>
